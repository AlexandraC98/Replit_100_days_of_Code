## ðŸŒŽ Intro
As a young doctor who just recently graduated from Med School, I've always found the idea of programming interesting, promising, though too challenging for me, too different from my field of work, somewhat unreachable. Nevertheless, I've always toyed with the possibility of being able to solve everyday medical problems through programming.

This is my first real step towards learning a whole different set of skills than what I'm used to.

## ðŸš€ Description

## ðŸ§  Thoughts:
_Started the challenge on June 19th, finished it on August 7th 2024._

I didn't realize it was possible for me to learn so much in such a short period of time, but here we are... I tackled coding like a marathon runner, minus the coffee (Iâ€™m not a fan).

I especially enjoyed the last 30 days. They were definitely the most challenging and delightful â€” full of interesting twists and turns that kept me on my toes!

Iâ€™m officially hooked and excited about diving even deeper into the tech world.
Hereâ€™s to coding adventures and new tech passions! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
